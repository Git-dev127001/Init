<h1> The parts of Human Psyche</h1>
<section class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 p1" ><div class="subtitle" >Id</div><div class="content">The id is the primitive and instinctive component of personality.The id is the impulsive part of our psyche which responds directly and immediately to basic urges, needs, and desires. The personality of the newborn child is all id and only later does it develop an ego and super-ego.The id remains infantile in its function throughout a person's life and does not change with time or experience, as it is not in touch with the external world. The id is not affected by reality, logic or the everyday world, as it operates within the unconscious part of the mind.</div></section>
<section class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 p2"><div class="subtitle">Ego</div>
<div class="content">The ego is 'that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world.'The ego develops to mediate between the unrealistic id and the external real world. It is the decision-making component of personality. Ideally, the ego works by reason, whereas the id is chaotic and unreasonable.
The ego operates according to the reality principle, working out realistic ways of satisfying the idâ€™s demands, often compromising or postponing satisfaction to avoid negative consequences of society. The ego considers social realities and norms, etiquette and rules in deciding how to behave.</div></section>
<section class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 p3" ><div class="subtitle">Super Ego</div>
<div class="content">The superego incorporates the values and morals of society which are learned from one's parents and others.The superego consists of two systems: The conscience and the ideal self. The conscience can punish the ego through causing feelings of guilt. For example, if the ego gives in to the id's demands, the superego may make the person feel bad through guilt.The ideal self (or ego-ideal) is an imaginary picture of how you ought to be, and represents career aspirations, how to treat other people, and how to behave as a member of society. </div></section>
